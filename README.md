# NavigationDemo

This is the demo of the Navigation Component of the Jetpack Library. This architecture is very useful for the single activity apps that we use.
It helps us to manage the backstack and also the navigation between the fragments becomes easy without adding too much of the boilerplate code.
This demo project shows the example of Navigation Component used along with bottom navigation. It also has a fetaure of push notifications, where a user can create a push notifition on button click. 
When that notification is clicked, a user is directed to a particular destination.

Also added a login screen to have authentication flow. This could be enhanced by adding Register screen and creating a nested graph for that part.
